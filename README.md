# Prediction-of-Concrete-Compressive-Strength
Prediction of Concrete Compressive Strength 

Project Description:
Overview
The objective of this project is to predict the compressive strength of concrete using 
various input components through machine learning techniques. We will utilize a 
dataset containing quantitative measurements of different concrete components 
and the resulting compressive strength. The primary focus will be on applying linear 
regression and SVM to establish a relationship between the input variables and the 
concrete compressive strength, which is a regression problem.
Expected Outcome:
By the end of this project, we aim to have a robust model that can accurately predict 
the compressive strength of concrete based on its components. This can aid in 
optimizing concrete mixtures for construction purposes, ensuring the desired 
strength and qualit
